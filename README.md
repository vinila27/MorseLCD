# MorseLCD
This project is designed to enable communication between an input of either a push button or PC putty terminal to a 16x2 LCD output.
Currently implemented microcontroller is an AVR ATMega328p on board an arduino uno breakout, although another microcontroller can be used by modifying the userconfig.h and compiler flag in the Makefile.
Follow the instructions in the userconfig.h file to select GPIO pins and other relevant settings.
